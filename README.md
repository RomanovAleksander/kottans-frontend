I finished the course How to use Git and GitHub. It was very interestung. 
I learned a lot of new git commands, made pull request and create repo.
## Linux CLI, and HTTP

It was new for me. I didn't think that via the command line we can do so many 
manipulations.
 I will use all the knowledge that I gained in this course in the future.

I knew HTML and CSS, so for me this course was not difficult. 
I resumed my knowledge and I was glad to study the basics again.
