![Git](task_GitAndGitHub/task0.1.jpg)
I finished the course How to use Git and GitHub. It was very interestung. 
I learned a lot of new git commands, made pull request and create repo.
## Linux CLI, and HTTP
![Linux CLI](task_linux_cli/task1.1.jpg)
It was new for me. I didn't think that via the command line we can do so many 
manipulations.
 I will use all the knowledge that I gained in this course in the future.
